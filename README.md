Arch-linux Tool to disable the fan on XPS13 (9350)

Program will disable turbo mode, lock cpu to 1ghz, gpu to minimum (300mhz for intel 540) and disable the fan for silent running. 

Run fan_on / fan_off with root


I have noticed that if the fan is already running it will keep running until its off and then stay off if fan_off is toggled
On testing my laptop will run up to 100C after a few minutes of stresstesting (gpu+cpu)
Normal usage for me temps and performance is fine. (browsing, coding, etc)
