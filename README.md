Arch-linux Tool to disable the fan on XPS13 (9350)

Program will disable turbo mode and fan for silent running. 
Run fan_on / fan_off with root

On my short testing i notice that laptop will run up to 100C after a few minutes of stresstesting (gpu+cpu)
Normal usage for me temps are fine. (browsing, coding, etc)
