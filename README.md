Arch-linux Tool to lock the fan on XPS13 (9350)

Program will disable turbo mode, lock cpu to 1ghz, gpu to minimum (300mhz for intel 540) and lock the fan for silent running. 
Go into silent mode when the fan is already off

Run xps_fan-unlock / xps_fan-lock / xps_silent  / xps_original with root

On testing my laptop will run up to 95c after a few minutes of stresstesting (gaming) running on 1.2ghz makes it 100c and throtting seems to occur.
Using a 4 thread cpu stresstest temps are ~65c
Normal usage for me temps and performance is fine. (browsing, coding, etc)
GPU seems to be the main contributor to the heat
